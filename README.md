# Radar

## Motivation

Before developing this Radar tool, we thoroughly contemplated a series of crucial questions that reveal the limitations of current project management tools and the challenges users may encounter in their daily management tasks.  The following questions reflect the design philosophy behind this tool and our commitment to addressing these challenges:

* Do you feel that traditional to-do list tools are not fully meeting your daily management needs?  For instance, some **routine** tasks are not one-off but occur regularly, necessitating ongoing reminders and fixed scheduling.

* Do you find it challenging to **quantify** your daily workload and distinguish between urgent tasks and routine checks?

* Have you recognized that certain topics are intricately **interconnected**?  Unlike the typically isolated entries in a to-do list, tasks can be intertwined, and these linkages often transcend simple hierarchical structures.  Hence, we necessitate a more refined strategy to organize them effectively.

If the challenges outlined in these questions resonate with your experience, then this tool might just be the solution you've been seeking.  We invite you to explore this tool, which could be the key to unlocking a more efficient approach to your management tasks.  Give it a try and see the difference it makes.
